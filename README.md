# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This README provides a concise orientation to how OctoAcme plans, executes, and improves product work, and links to the detailed process documents stored in docs/.

OctoAcme follows a lightweight, stage-gated lifecycle that moves work from initiation through planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Initiation validates the business need with a Project One-pager that captures problem, goals, success metrics, stakeholders, and a go/no‑go decision. Planning turns approved initiatives into a prioritized backlog, estimates scope, defines the Definition of Done, identifies dependencies and risks, and produces a release timeline and milestones. Execution uses a project board and a standard workflow (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and emphasizes small, reviewable pull requests with CI validation and clear acceptance criteria.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit to reduce ambiguity: Project Manager (coordinates delivery, risks, and communications), Product Manager (defines outcomes and priorities), Developers (build and test), QA (validate acceptance), and Stakeholders (approve and provide inputs). Communication is rhythm-driven — daily standups for blockers, weekly delivery syncs and PM–PdM alignment, monthly stakeholder updates, and templated weekly status and incident messages. Escalation paths are defined (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor) and the project README or release docs serve as the single source of truth.

Quality assurance and release discipline are enforced through automated testing and CI checks (unit, integration, security scans), end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and manual QA where needed. Pull requests should be small, include acceptance criteria, pass CI/linting, and receive at least one approval before merge. Releases require passing CI and security checks, drafted release notes, a rollback/mitigation plan, and pre/post-deploy smoke tests. Retrospectives and incident post-mortems drive continuous improvement, with action items tracked back into the backlog and the risk register.
